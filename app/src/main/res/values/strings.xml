    <!-- Info -->
    <string name="info_diabetes_title">General</string>
    <string name="info_diabetes_description">Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes and
        is characterized by insulin resistance. The insulin is ineffective in the body, resulting in
        rising blood sugar levels. To lower these blood sugar levels, the pancreas produces more
        insulin. Over time, this can exhaust the pancreas resulting in less insulin production and
        rising blood sugar levels.\n
        Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, is essential for the
        processing of glucose from food in the body. Carbohydrates in food are broken down into
        glucose in the stomach and intestines. Glucose is then by cells in the intestines and
        released into the bloodstream to be transported throughout the body. Glucose is used for
        energy production in cells.\n
        However, glucose is unable to pass through the cell membrane of
        most cells. Insulin stimulates the uptake of glucose into cells. Being unable to produce or
        use insulin effectively leads to increased blood sugar levels (hyperglycaemia), which can
        cause serious health problems.

    <string name="info_causes_title">Causes</string>
    <string name="info_causes_description">Type 2 diabetes is caused by several factors including
        genetic predisposition, increasing age and modifiable lifestyle factors such as:\n
        - Being overweight or obese\n
        - Unhealthy diet\n
        - Physical inactivity\n
        - Smoking\n
        - Certain medicines
    </string>

    <string name="info_complications_title">Complications</string>
    <string name="info_complications_description">Type 2 diabetes patients have an increased risk of
        developing serious diseases including:\n
        - Cardiovascular disease\n
        - Kidney damage\n
        - Nerve damage\n
        - Eye damage\n
        - Slow healing wounds\n
        - Alzheimer\'s disease\n

        In nearly all high-income countries, diabetes is the primary cause of blindness,
        cardiovascular disease, lower limb amputation and kidney failure.

    <string name="info_management_title">Management</string>
    <string name="info_management_description">Type 2 diabetes can be managed through lifestyle
        modification including regular exercise, a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy body weight
        and smoking cessation. However, type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease, which means that
        the pancreas may not be able to produce enough insulin to keep the blood sugar level within
        the target range, regardless of the lifestyle modification. People with type 2 diabetes
        should then take oral medication to keep the blood sugar level within the target range.
        If this is still not sufficient, insulin injections may be necessary.  The injections and
        oral medication are intended to be used in combination with regular exercise and healthy
        eating, not as a substitute.
